LibreOffice/OpenOffice macro for Hungarian cash report (időszaki pénztárjelentés)

This macro is written for use in LibreOffice or OpenOffice. Given a properly formatted .ods file (having the rigth columns with validated data), upon running it prepares a cash book report table which can then be saved as a pdf, and after printing submittied to tax authorities.

The macro puts data into chronological order, sums incomes and expenses, formats values according to Hungarian standards, ands an identifier based on the period of the data and default settings. It also formats the pdf page ready for printing to have all eleents which are requred by the tax office.

The macro only works properly with the attached penztarjelentes.ods (OpenOffice/LibreOffice Calc) file.It can either be copy pasted into the ods file as its own macro, or directly into the Calc application and configured as a menu option.

Note. Although the format is according to the official reuirements, this is not an official document approved or audited by the Hungarian tax authorities, so use it at your own risk.
